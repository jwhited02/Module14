This is my Module 14 - Bellybutton Challenge
##
This is my second attempt at this challenge. I was having major issues getting this to launch on a webpage so I ended up just starting over completely and trying to reset. 
##
At the beginning, this challenge went pretty smoothly for me, as it did the last time. I was able to get the app to run perfectly from the live browser on VS code, but when I tried to get it on Github Pages there was no data. I struggled for a bit trying to figure out why this was happening, but ultimately figured out that the issue was with a couple of my filepaths. One was referencing the data, and one was referencing the app. Once I got that fixed I was able to get it running on GitHub pages finally. Once I thought I had it fixed, right when I was about to turn it in I tested it and it went back to not working. Very frustrating. I tried just making a new repository and deploying a new github pages, and that worked. I still have no idea why I needed to create a new one but am very glad it worked and I hope it works for you as well!
