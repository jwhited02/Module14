This is my Module 14 - Bellybutton Challenge
##
At the beginning, this challenge went pretty smoothly for me. I was able to get the app to run perfectly from the live browser on VS code, but when I tried to get it on Github Pages there was no data. I struggled for a bit trying to figure out why this was happening, but ultimately figured out that the issue was with a couple of my filepaths. One was referencing the data, and one was referencing the app. Once I got that fixed I was able to get it running on GitHub pages finally. 
##
The app.js file is located in the "Static" folder
The index.html is located in the main directory
